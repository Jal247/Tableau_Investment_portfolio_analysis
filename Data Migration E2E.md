Trickle migration known as a phased or iterative migration, this approach brings Agile experience to data transfer. It breaks down the entire process into sub-migrations, each with its own goals, timelines, scope, and quality checks.

Trickle migration involves parallel running of the old and new systems and transferring data in small increments. As a result, you take advantage of zero downtime and your customers are happy because of the 24/7 application availability.

Conversely, the iterative strategy takes much more time and adds complexity to the project. Your migration team must track which data has already been transported and ensure users can switch between two systems to access the required information.

Another way to perform trickle migration is to keep the old application entirely operational until the end of the migration. As a result, your clients will use the old system as usual and switch to the new application only when all data is successfully loaded to the target environment.

However, this scenario doesn’t make things easier for your engineers. They have to make sure that data is synchronized in real time across two platforms once it is created or changed. In other words, any changes in the source system must trigger updates in the target system.

Verdict. Trickle migration is the right choice for medium and large enterprises that can’t afford long downtime but have enough expertise to face technological challenges.


Data migration process
No matter the approach, the data migration project goes through the same key phases — namely

planning,
data auditing and profiling,
data backup,
migration design,
execution,
testing, and
post-migration audit.

**Storage migration :**
Storage migration occurs when a business acquires modern technologies, discarding out-of-date equipment. It entails transporting data from one physical medium to another or from a physical to a virtual environment. Examples of such migrations are

**from paper to digital documents :**,
from hard disk drives (HDDs) to faster and more durable solid-state drives (SSDs), or
from mainframe computers to cloud storage.
The primary reason for this shift is a pressing need for technology upgrades rather than a lack of storage space. When it comes to large-scale systems, the migration process can take years. Say, Sabre, the second-largest global distribution system (GDS), had been moving its software and data from mainframe computers to virtual servers for over a decade.

**Database migration :**
A database is not just a place to store data. It provides a structure to organize information in a specific way and is typically controlled via a database management system (DBMS).

So, most of the time, database migration means

an upgrade to the latest version of DBMS (so-called homogeneous migration),
a switch to a new DBMS from a different provider — for example, from MySQL to PostgreSQL or from Oracle to MSSQL (so-called heterogeneous migration).
The latter case is tougher, especially if the target and source databases support different data structures. It makes the task even more challenging when moving data from legacy databases—like Adabas, IMS, or IDMS.

**Application migration :**
When a company changes an enterprise software vendor—for instance, a hotel implements a new property management system (PMS) or a hospital replaces its legacy EHR system — this requires moving data from one computing environment to another. The key challenge here is that old and new infrastructures may have unique data models and work with different data formats.

**Data center migration :**
A data center is a physical infrastructure used by organizations to store their critical applications and data. Put more precisely, it’s a very dark room with servers, networks, switches, and other IT equipment. Data center migration can mean different things, from relocating existing computers and wires to other premises to moving all digital assets (data and business applications) to new servers and storage.

**Business process migration :**
This type of migration is driven by mergers and acquisitions, business optimization, or reorganization to address competitive challenges or enter new markets. All these changes may require transferring business applications and databases with data on customers, products, and operations to the new environment.

**Cloud migration :**
Cloud migration is a popular term that embraces all the above-mentioned cases if they involve moving data from on-premises to the cloud or between different cloud environments.

Depending on volumes of data and differences between source and target locations, migration can take 30 minutes to months and even years. The project's complexity and the downtime cost define how exactly to unwrap the process.
