1. Business Problem
   
A leading investment bank needed to enhance its portfolio performance tracking and customer investment insights. The existing system had:

- 	Fragmented data from multiple sources (transaction records, CRM, external market data).
- 	Manual reporting inefficiencies, leading to delays in decision-making.
- 	Lack of interactive dashboards, making it hard for senior leaders to extract actionable insights.

The goal was to develop an automated BI solution with real-time insights, predictive analytics, and enhanced visualization for senior executives and financial advisors.

2. Solution Approach
   
As a Business System Analyst, I led the initiative to:

A. Data Collection & Integration

-	Collaborated with data engineers to integrate data from Azure Data Lake, Databricks, and CRM systems.
-	Conducted data profiling and cleansing to ensure accuracy and consistency.
-	Optimized SQL queries to enhance data extraction and performance.

B. Dashboard Development & Data Visualization

•	Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau with:

    - Level of Detail (LOD) expressions for dynamic aggregations.
    - Action filters & user filters for personalized insights.
    - Advanced KPIs like ROI, risk-adjusted returns, and customer segmentation.
    
•	Enabled visual storytelling by transforming complex datasets into easy-to-understand insights.

C. Predictive Analytics & Insights

- 	Developed Python-based predictive models to forecast investment trends and portfolio risks.
- 	Implemented A/B testing frameworks to evaluate the impact of financial strategies.
- 	Analyzed market trends and customer behavior to refine investment strategies.

D. Data Governance & Compliance

-	Established data governance best practices, ensuring data quality, regulatory compliance, and security.
-	Worked with stakeholders to implement role-based access controls using Azure Active Directory (AAD).

E. Stakeholder Collaboration & Business Impact
