When an investment firm provides portfolio details, they typically include static details (recorded at the time of investment) and dynamic details (which update periodically, often via APIs).

Dynamic Data (Fetched via API): 
To update the current asset value, we integrate APIs such as:

Stock Market API (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) → for real-time stock prices
Cryptocurrency API (CoinGecko, Binance API) → for live crypto prices
Gold API (Metals-API) → for live gold rates
Real Estate API (Zillow, Realtor API) → for property valuations

## Data Governance Rules for Investment Dashboard
Since investment dashboard is accessible to bank executives and individual customers, data governance is crucial for ensuring data security, compliance, accuracy, and integrity. Below are the customized rules:

**1. Data Quality & Accuracy Rules**

🔹 Ensure accuracy – Investment data (portfolio value, ROI, risk level) must be validated against real-time sources (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg).

🔹 Completeness – All fields (Customer ID, Asset Type, Investment Date, etc.) must be captured to avoid missing information.

🔹 Standardized Formats – Date fields should use YYYY-MM-DD, currency in USD/CAD, and numerical values formatted to two decimal places.

🔹 Automated Data Refresh – Stock and crypto values should be updated every 5 minutes, while bond and real estate values should refresh daily/weekly.

💡 Example: If an executive views a customer’s investment performance, they must see real-time, accurate data instead of outdated values.

2️⃣ Data Security & Access Control

🔹 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Bank Executives → View all customer investments (anonymized PII).
Customers → View only their own investment data.
Admin/Compliance Teams → Full access to audit logs and compliance reports.

🔹 Encryption Standards:
  -  Data in transit: TLS 1.3
  -  Data at rest: AES-256
🔹 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Require MFA for executives & customers accessing financial data.

🔹 PII Protection – Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like Customer Name, Contact Info, and Account Numbers must be hashed/masked in logs.

💡 Example: A bank executive should not see customer names but can view aggregated investment trends.

3️⃣ Data Retention & Compliance Rules

🔹 Regulatory Adherence:

Follow GDPR (for EU clients), CCPA (for US clients), and PIPEDA (for Canada).
Ensure investment transaction data retention for 7 years (as per financial regulations).

🔹 Audit Trails: Maintain logs of who accessed data, when, and what changes were made.

🔹 Anonymization After Retention Period: Once 7 years have passed, anonymize investment records but keep summary analytics.

💡 Example: If a regulator audits the bank’s investment platform, all customer data access logs should be available for review.

4️⃣ Data Governance for API Integrations

🔹 Validated Data Sources:

  - Stocks: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance
  - Gold: Yahoo Finance, LBMA Gold Price API
  - Crypto: CoinGecko, Binance API
  - Bonds & Real Estate: Bloomberg, FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
    
🔹 Rate Limits & Caching:
Avoid hitting API rate limits by caching data every 5 minutes for stocks & crypto, daily for bonds & real estate.

🔹 Data Synchronization:
If an API fails, fallback to last known value with a timestamp.

💡 Example: If Yahoo Finance API fails, the dashboard should display cached prices with a timestamp instead of an error.

5️⃣ Data Governance for AI & Predictive Analytics (If Used)

🔹 Transparency in AI Models:
Clearly state the logic behind ROI predictions, risk assessment, and asset recommendations.

🔹 Bias Mitigation:
Ensure AI does not favor high-net-worth clients over smaller investors.

🔹 Auditability of AI Outputs:
Store historical AI-generated recommendations for explainability and compliance audits.

💡 Example: If an AI model recommends an investment shift, customers must see why it was suggested.

6️⃣ Data Governance for Cloud Storage & Infrastructure

🔹 Cloud Security Best Practices:
Use AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage with encryption at rest.
Implement DDoS protection to prevent API attacks.

🔹 Data Classification & Storage Policies:
   - Customer Portfolio Data → Encrypted in high-security storage.
   - Market Data (Stocks, Gold, Crypto) → Cached in a low-latency database for quick retrieval.

💡 Example: If a cyberattack occurs, the bank should be able to track and isolate compromised data.
